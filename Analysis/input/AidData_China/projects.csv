Ltd (KPLC) Jasper Oduorto and Kenyan Energy Minister Kiraitu Murungi announced that funding had been secured for Phase 1 of a project to expand Kenyan energy capacity and access to energy. Under the project, the state-owned KPLC would connect 150,000 new power consumers every year. Phase 1 of the project includes plans to establish a 61 km long 132kV line from Chemosit to Kisii, where a sub-station will be constructed, as well as the construction of several power distribution lines. Media sources indicate that China provided a 25 million USD soft loan for Phase 1 and could potentially provide another 35 million USD loan for Phase 2. Later KPLC reports indicate that Phase 1 was financed by 'about 20 million USD' concessional loan from the Exim Bank, and that it began implementation. Phase 2, which may or may not have secured funding, involves construction of a 220kV transmission line from Olkaria geothermal power station near Naivasha to Lessos sub-station. Also proposed under this phase is the establishment of a 132kV transmission line from Rabai sub-station to the tourism hub of the South Coast (note: discrepancy, as another source says a 122-km long, 132kV line will go from Kamburu hydropower substation to Meru). This appears to be connected to project #606, the Olkaria II Geothermal Project. As part of the agreement to fund the project, KPLC agreed to procure materials and equipment from Chinese companies. Reports show that China CAMC exchanged information with KPLC, but do not show whether the China CAMC was involved in the implementation of the project. The extent to which Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the project have been completed is also unknown.

At the summit, China's Exim Bank awarded Equatorial Guinea a non-concessional credit line of 2 billion USD to complete a series of infrastructure projects, namely to improve and provide electricity to the Bata Harbour. The terms of the loan consisted of a 5.5% interest rate, a maturity of 5 years and a grace period of 2 years, and the loan is to be repaid in oil to the Exim Bank. The repayment must be equal to 30% of the outstanding stock of debt. As a result of this deal, Unipec (the trading arm of Chinese state owned Sinopec) received a contract for the delivery of 15,000 barrels per day of crude oil from the Zafiro field for a five year period. In 2007, the Government of Equatorial Guinea laid the foundation for the Bata Port expansion and rehabilitation project. The Chinese state-owned China Road and Bridge Engineering Corp. was contracted to complete the project. The total cost for the port project is 300 million EUR, but it is unclear how much of that total will be provided by the Chinese. It is also unclear if the port project was completed. In an interview conducted on January 28, 2013 by Equatorial Guinea Press, Maria Luisa Mangue Obiang, the young Assistant Director-General of Ports in Equatorial Guinea, said that work on the port began in 2009 with Chinese companies Somagec and China Road and supervised by SNC Lavalin. There have been a number of updates on the port but there are more projects in store for the port. She gave no indication of when the project would be completely finished.

The loan was signed by CDB and Ghana on December 16, 2011. In February 2012, the Ghanaian parliament approved the agreement at the recommendation of the deputy speaker of parliament, Edward Doe Adjaho. According to Ghanaian government officialsâ€™ projections of oil prices, Ghana will end up paying 6.4 billion USD to China for the 3 billion USD loan or will give away 750 million barrels of the nationâ€™s crude oil to a Chinese company for more than 15 years. The loan agreement stipulates that 60% of all contracts under the loan go to Chinese companies. The mega-loan is split evenly between two sections called Tranche A and Tranche B. The first tranche includes 1.5 billion USD at 15 year repayment with a 5 year grace period; the interest rate is LIBOR plus 2.95%. There is an upfront fee of 0.25% of the loan and a commitment fee of 1% per year on the undrawn and un-cancelled balance of the loan. Tranche B has a 10 year repayment period with 3 year grace period; the interest rate is LIBOR plus 2.85%. The money will be available for six years after the agreement was signed. Principal and interest payments will be made to CDB every six months after the grace periods. There are 12 eligible projects that the loan might cover, each detailed below: 1. Western Corridor Infrastructure Renewal Project - Takoradi-Kumasi; Dunkwa-Awaso Railway Line Scenario 1 Retrofit (Estimated Allocation of 450-500 million USD) 2. Western Corridor Infrastructure Renewal Project - Takoradi Port Retrofit Phase 1 (Estimated Allocation of 150-200 million USD) 3. Sekondi Free Zone Project - Shared infrastructure and utility services (Estimated Amount of 100 million USD) 4. Accra Plains Irrigation Project (Phase 1: 5000 ha) (Estimated Amount 100 million USD) 5. Coastal Fishing Harbors and Landing Sites Re-development Project - Axim, Dixcove, Elmina, Winneba, Mumford, Senya-Beraku, Jamestown, Teshie, Tema, Ada, Keta (Estimated Amount of 150-250 million USD), 6. Eastern Corridor Multi-modal Transportation Project - Upgrade of Volta Lake Ferries, Pontoons and Landing Sites - Kpandu-Amankwakrom, Kete Krachi-Kwadokrom, Yeji-Makongo, Tapa Aboatoase, Dzemini; Upgrade of Akosombo and Buipe Ports (Estimated Amount of 150-500 million USD), To this end, engineers are currently working to replace the old engines on the existing ferries with the new eight main and auxiliary engines procured under the World Bank Credit facility. This will improve ferry services across the Volta Lake. Under the CDB facility, an amount of 450 million USD has been allocated to the Eastern Corridor Multi-Modal Transport Project (ECMMTP) comprising: â€¢ upgrading and developing Akosombo and Buipe ports infrastructure; â€¢ upgrading and procuring vessels, other marine works and â€¢ upgrading 700km of feeder roads to selected ferry stations on the Volta Lake' 7. Western Corridor Gas Infrastructure Project - Offshore gas gathering pipeline, early phase gas processing plant, onshore gas trunk pipeline (Pumpuni Dispatch Terminal), NGLs Processing Retrofit (Tema Oil Refinery), Helicopter Surveillance Fleet. IN IMPLEMENTATION. - This project already had submitted a subsidiary agreement to Parliament for approval. - Includes Gas Processing Plant of 150 million standard cubic feet, a 36km shallow water offshore pipeline from the FPSO to the Plant, a 120km onshore pipeline from the gas processing plant to Aboadze, a 75Â­km onshore pipeline from Esiama to Prestea, a jetty for the export of natural gas liquids, and an operations and control office complex. - As of June 2013, the contractor Sinopec had been pre-financing this project, and the Government of Ghana was seeking additional bridge financing. 8. Western Corridor Petroleum Terminal Project 9. Western Corridor Oil Enclave Toll Road Project 10. Accra Metropolitan Area ICT - Enhanced Traffic Management Project (road completion components) 11. Integrated National Security Communications Enhancement Project - Deployment of ICT Enhanced Surveillance Platform for Western Corridor Oil Enclave (Estimated amount of 150 million USD) 12. SME Projects Incubation Facility - Facility Management Contracts with local financial institutions (Estimated amount of 100 million USD) Each project carries with it a necessary subsidiary agreement that must be signed by the MoFEP and CDB before money will be disbursed. No more than 5 of these agreements can be submitted per year. The CDB will provide financing for 85% of total project costs and the government of Ghana will finance the remaining 15%, according to the framework agreement signed between Iiang Chaoliang, President of the China Development Bank Corporation, and Fifi Kwetey, Ghana's Deputy Finance Minister, on September 20, 2010. There is some discrepancy among sources for this project; several sources state that China agreed to provide 2.85 billion USD loan to fund a road improvement project.

It will reduce the transportation time on Ethiopia's main import-export route from three hours to one hour. The project, an estimated total cost of $612 million, will be financed by a $350 million Export-Import Bank of China loan, and the Ethiopian government covering the balance. Construction began in April 2010. According to Samson Wondimu, Communication Director of ERA, construction was more than 30% complete in April 2012. This project has provided the groundwork for the use of innovative technology via tolls and creates local employment opportunities. It is also expected to contribute to the development of roadways between capital and regional locations, such as Hawassa and Bale. Construction is expected to be completed in early 2014. Terms of the loan are uncertain, but Deborah Brautigam reports tolls will help repay the loan over 20 years.

Work started in June of 2004 under an interest-free loan agreement worth $28 million USD between Ghana and China. The terms of the loan were that it would be repaid in annual installments by the Ghanaian government over a period of ten years from November of 2012 to October of 2022 with export commodities of Ghana or convertible currencies to be agreed upong by the two governments. The road, 17.4 km in length, has no restrictions to vehicular traffic. The road is part of the Accra-Kumasi trunk road rehabilitation project. The contracting firm for the project is China Railway Engineering Corporation. The project includes the construction of a 20 meter fly-over bridge over the rail line near Ofankor. The design can handle 13 tons. The construction of the road was started by the New Patriotic Party administration under former president Kufuor via Internally Generated Funds.

Sources dispute when the funding of the loan agreement was signed-- one source states that it was signed on September 28, 2010 while another lists December 17, 2010. Finance Minister Sanousse Toure publicly stated that the 250-km road would run from the capital Bamako to the central town of Segou. The implementing agency is the China Road and Bridge Corporation. A Malian company is also responsible for oversight of the the project, although its name remains unknown. The project was suspended in 2011 due to a coup, but construction resumed on June 22, 2012. According to news reports, Chinese ambassador Cao Zhongming played a key part in resumption of the project.The project has two phases. The first phase of project involves rehabilitation of the existing road, and has secured financing of 73 million XOF. The second phase of the project involves construction of new road and will cost 86.6 billion CFA francs. It is not clear whether funding for the project's second phase has been secured.

The dam was financed by two separately negotiated China Exim bank loans. One was a commercial export buyersâ€™ credit of US$292 million with 12 yearsâ€™ maturity, a grace period of five years and an interest rate set at a margin of 1.075 per cent over the prevailing Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRR). The other, with a fixed interest rate of 2 per cent, appeared to be either a concessional loan or a preferential export credit, for about US$270 million. Development Assistance Committee rules recommend that a mixed credit like this be reported separately: â€˜one for the â€œsoftâ€ loan [ODA] and one for the commercial loan [OOF]. â€˜Tied aidâ€™ like this is allowed under OECD rules for projects that cannot attract commercial financing, although OECD members would be required to report the offer and its terms so that other OECD members could compete on the same terms if they were so inclined (Brautigam 2010). Just like some of China Eximbankâ€™s larger credits in countries such as Angola, the Bui Dam project finance was a resource-secured loan. In this case, it was guaranteed not through oil or minerals, but through export sales of cocoa beans. Genertec Corporation of China has a cocoa sales agreement with the Ghana Cocoa Board for up to 40 000 Mt of cocoa beans (30Â 000 main crop; 10 000 light crop) annually over the life of the loanâ€”that is, 20 years. By September of 2009, EXIM Bank had disbursed 41.73 US million dollars to Ghana for the project. China Eximbank also required Bui Hydropower to have a power purchase agreement with the Electricity Company of Ghana. The net revenue from this will be deposited into an escrow account to help repay the loan. The price for the future electricity was tentatively negotiated to be in a range between US$0.035 and US$0.055 cents kW/h (Habia 2009). The first power generating unit of 133 megawatts from the Bui hydroelectric project became operational on May 3, 2013, with plans for all 400 megawatts to come online by end of 2013. Two additional loans were made by China in 2012 for this project (ID# 30086). Sinohydro was contractor, and reports the contract total as US $596 million on its website. On May 3, 2013 President John Dramani Mahama, accompanied by a number of central and local government officials, and the Chinese Ambassador to Ghana, attended an inauguration ceremony for the dam's first turbine, with construction of the remain 3 turbines expected by the end of the year.";230;Energy Generation and Supply;"Electricity; Hydro-generation";Completion;3;Loan (excluding debt rescheduling);Ghana;"http://www.pennenergy.com/index/articles/pe-article-tools-template.articles.hrhrw.News.Ghanas_cocoa_to_help_pay_China_for_building_400-MW_Bui.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020070903e393000wv&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.sinohydro.com/664-2227-438511.aspx, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://www.docstoc.com/docs/76483699/Mou-for-Project-Loan, Other Academic (Working Paper, Dissertation); http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020080926e49q00039&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://ghananewsagency.org/economics/phase-two-of-bui-hydro-project-takes-off-5204, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-188009334/ghana-china-sign-seven.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-188451344/ghana-china-approves-562m.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=DJI0000020070420e34k00021&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.chinapower.com.cn/newsarticle/1105/new1105544.asp, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.american.edu/sis/faculty/upload/Brautigam-Chinese-Aid-in-Africa.pdf, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://www.mofep.gov.gh/sites/default/files/budget/Budget_2010.pdf, Other; http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/photo/2013-05/04/c_132358435_2.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://eng.sinohydro.com/index.php?m=content&c=index&a=show&catid=42&id=127, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.mofep.gov.gh/sites/default/files/news/2011_Annual_Progress_Report.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=274883, Media Report, including Wikileaks";16;Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency;"Sinohydro Corporation, State-Owned Company; Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod), State-Owned Company; Genertec Corporation, State-Owned Company; Electricity Company of Ghana, State-Owned Company";"Sinohydro Corporation, State-Owned Company; Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency; Genertec Corporation, State-Owned Company";3;"Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod), State-Owned Company; Electricity Company of Ghana, State-Owned Company";2;Checked;1;Vague (Official Finance);5;Development;1;Active;1;"http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020070903e393000wv&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020080926e49q00039&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=DJI0000020070420e34k00021&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks";562000000;USD;0,837994837;1;670648523,1;562000000;01.

The project was expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2010. The center was supposedly one of two agricultural research centres being built by China and will boast agricultural laboratories and crop-testing areas, and will also undertake aquaculture research. The Chinese government is investing a total of US$700 million in the centres. On July 9, 2011 China handed over the completed Agrarian Technology Transfer Center in Umbeluzi in the district of Boane in the capital Maputo at a cost of 6 million USD. More information needed about the discrepancy between the 700 million needed for both centers and the 6 million it cost to build one. Associated with project ID#1211 and ID#1197. Deborah Brautigam notes the discrepancy in footnote 11 of her blog-post in the sources below.

The Kpong Water Supply Extension Project covers a planning calendar that extends to 2015 and includes enhancement of transmission lines to increase water supply by an additional 40 million gallons a day. Checks by the Daily Graphic from the Ghana Water Company [GWCL] indicated that work had already begun on the assessment, which should be taken between three and six months to complete. The construction of a new intake and water pumping station for bulk water supply from Kpong with capacity of 196,000 cubic metres per day will form the first phase, with the second phase covering the construction of a new treatment plant of 186,000 cubic metres or 41 million gallons a day. The third phase consists of a new treated water pumping station as well as a pressure transmission (mains) system from Kpong to Accra through Oyibi to terminate at Okponglo [suburb of Accra] out in the five-year plan. (PPIAF) In 2010, the Chinese government agreed to provide Ghana with preferential buyer's credit worth $260 million USD for the execution of the Kpong Water Expansion Supply Project to help boost water delivery systems in the country. The facility has a grace period of five years, repayment duration of 15 years, maturity period of 20 years, interest rate of 2 percent per annum, a commitment fee of 0.75 percent per annum, a management fee of 1 percent flat, and a grant element of 37.08 percent. The total project cost is $273 million, with the remaining $13 million USD provided by the Ghanaian government. The project when completed, would increase water supply from Kpong Head Works to Accra and Tema to improve the reliability of potable water delivery to domestic, commercial and industrial customers. The project is expected to be completed in 2014. As of July 2012, the project was 30 percent complete.

An agreement for $8.2 million USD for an ICT based distance learning programme at the University of Ghana was also signed. The Exim Bank of China also signed with the government another concessional loan agreement for the based distance learning project at the University of Ghana. Budget documents from the Ghanain government show China had disbursed $1.62 million for this project by September 2009. In December of 2009, Phase One of the project was launched. Its purpose is to improve the quality of teaching and learning and to increase access to education. The Phase 1 of the ICT in Distance Education deployed UGNet, which is a highly available, secure and reliable information infrastructure backbone that currently connects all the major buildings on the University of Ghana Campus at Legon, and provides internet connectivity, email and IP-based services to Faculty and Departments. In addition, connectivity was provided to the Accra-City Campus and the College of Health Sciences at Korle-bu.

Officials from the Ministry of Finance, representatives from China's Eximbank and Sinosure signed the agreement. Sinosure was to provide insurance cover for loans for projects supported by the Eximbank. On March 21, 2011 Zimbabwean Vice President Joice Mujuru signed a $144 million USD loan agreement for the development and rehabilitation of water works and sewers in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare. Specifically the funds would rehabilitate, replace, install and commission equipment at Morton Jaffray and Prince Edward Water Treatment plants and Crowborough and Firle Sewage plants. The project would be implemented by China National Machinery and Equipment Corporation (CNMEC) and funded by the China Eximbank. Some reports also mention the involvement of China Development Bank leaders in negotiations, although the role of the CDB in the project is unclear. Contacts for this project include Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan who attended the loan's signing ceremony, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Tendai Biti, and Mr Li Riougu, the president of the Export-Import Bank of China. Later reports in December 2011 say that the Zimbabwean Cabinet had not yet approved the loan. Controversy arose as to whether the Chinese funding agencies had stipulated that the Zimbabwean local authority would have to pay an 8% interest of over USD $11 million in penalties due to delays in taking up the funds. Separate reports in 2012 and 2013 indicate the Harare City Council is yet to receive the funding, due to the government's failure to pay interest on a 1997 loan advanced to the then Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Industries. Other sources, such as town clerk Tendai Machachi, denied that the Chinese were making such demands. Further information regarding the updated status of this project is unknown.

The Halele Werabesa power project, about 70 km from Welkite, will consist of twin-dams on the Halele and Werabasa Rivers, which are 30 km apart. The Halele Werabsea project is expected to commence construction in 2013 and to be operational in 2018 at the earliest. The project will cost between 650 and 700 million USD, including the budget for a 79 km transmission line to carry generated electric power, estimated at 2,300 GWH/year. Officials report that Ethiopia plans to export excess electric power to Sudan, Djibouti, and Kenya.

A Chinese long-term soft loan will cover 85% of the cost, with the balance covered by the Ethiopian government. Shanghai Electric Group will construct the Wolaita-Soddo and Akaki substations as well as the Gilgel Gibe II and Sebeta substation expansion, each 400 kv capacity substations at a cost of 1.3 billion birr. CGGC will underake the Koka and Awash Sebat Kilo substations. A 2013 blog provided information about the status, capacity, and financial values of the individual substations. One of the lots includes the construction of a 293Km transmission line, starting from Wolayta Sodo and running to Sebeta, via Akaki. The construction of this line will cost a total of 70.8 million dollars and an additional 140.5 million Br from the government. The other lot, a 50.3Km and 51Km double circuit line from Gibe III to the Wolayta Sodo distribution station, will be constructed for 25.9 million in dollars, and an additional 17.2 million Br contribution from the government. The construction of the transmission lines will be done by the end of June. Once construction is completed, the transmission lines will not be able to be used until power is generated from the dam (Gibe III). The dam is to have 10 units, each producing 187Mw of power. EEPCo expects to finish the construction of one of the units by September or October this year. The power generated can then be added to the National Grid through the transmission lines. The completion of distribution stations is also necessary.. There will be two new distribution stations, in Wolayta Sodo and Akaki, and an expansion project on an old distribution station in Sebeta, which cost 88.5 million dollars and 198.3 million Br in contributions from the government.

Qiyuan initiated the idea of building an industrial zone in Ethiopia and the participation of Yonggang, a much larger conglomerate, guaranteed financing so that it won the second MOFCOM bidding in 2007. Later, two additional Zhangjiagang companies, Jianglian and Yangyang Asset Management, joined the project.When completed, up to 80 compaines involved in textiles, leather, and manufacturing construction equipment are expected to invest in the industrial zone, which is intended to help Ethiopia emulate China's patter of accelerated development, according to Trade and Industry Minister Tadesse Haile. The industrial zone is also expected to create 20,000 local jobs. The government reports that it plans to build five more industrial zones throughout the country to attract further foreign investment.Zhangjiagang Free Trade Zone was brought in as a technical partner, but not as a shareholder. Because of financial difficulties, however, Yonggang left the project early in 2009 and the smaller company, Qiyuan, has become the major shareholder and executor (Interview, Eastern Industrial Park Management, 2009).Because of the Chinese partnersâ€™ financial difficulties (related to the global economic crisis), the area of the zone has been reduced from 5 to 2 square kilometers (500 to 200 hectares) and the investment from renminbi (RMB) 1 billion (US$146 million) to RMB 690 million (US$101 million).

The loan stipulates $114.9 million for the project's 335MW power plant, signed in 2002, at 6% interest, a grace period of 6 years, maturity in 12 years.The total cost of the project was $359.71 million, with a Chinese commitment of $297.75 million funded by the Export-Import Bank of China. Additional funding may have come from the Nigeria Power and Steel Department. The plant was put into operation in 2007. Nigerian former president Obasanjo stated in 2007 that Papalanto, as well as Chinese-financed Omotosho, were generating power for Nigeria's electricity grid in May 2007.

As part of the deal, the Nigerian Government agreed to pay for Chinese companies to help manage the power plants after construction is completed in two years' time.

He said, work would begin on a multi-million dollar project that involves the construction of a railway line, through the Shai Hills, to link the ports of Tema and Akosombo. He explained that goods and containers bound for the northern part of Ghana and other land locked countries, would be transport from the Tema Port via train to Akosombo and ferried along the Volta River to Yeji, for further transportation to their intended destinations by land. In October 2010, John Atta Mills, Ghanaian President, inaugurated the train service worth $23 million USD on the rail network. Construction on the project commenced in December of 2004, rehabilitating the existing Tema - Accra - Nsawam suburban railway, and constructing new lines and bridges. The first phase of the Accra-Tema line (Accra to Asoprochonaa) was inaugurated in December 2007. The government financed phase one with a loan of $5m, $500,000 from matching funds and $2.58m from the HIPC (Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) funds. OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) granted a loan of $5m in 2005 for the project also. In 2007, the government awarded a design, build, operate and transfer contract to Peatrack for expansion, reconstruction and operation of a rail network between Accra-Tema and Paga.

The project includes roughly 1366 km of transmission lines and five 220 kV substations, thirteen 110 kV substations, and eight 20 kV substations to distribute power to 25 cities in mainland Equatorial Guinea. It appears that the project is still under construction. International Rivers reported this project as completed in 2011, implemented by Sinohydro, and funded with $257 from the Exim Bank of China, and Sinohydro's website also lists this as their largest project in Equatorial Guinea.

A bilateral agreement covering the 20-year concessional loan, to be repaid at 2.5% interest, was signed during a visit to Gabon by the Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, according to the Gabon government. On October 18, 2010 an overhaul of the Libreville power grid began. The project involves the design of the new power grid, equipment supply, and construction. Overall, three new substations will be built on top of the expansion of four existing ones. Three new overhead transmission lines and two underground cable transmission lines will also be added. The first part of the project began on October 21 when the management workers came to the work site to start the renovation process. The project should take 2 years to complete. The Chinese have loaned Gabon the money through a $130 million US dollar loan for 20 years with 2.5% annual interest. The construction faced difficulties in acquiring adequate lands from private property, and it was thus delayed for actual construction until 2012. The status of the grid is uncertain.

It is uncertain if the referenced project is related:(The project involves the construction of three new power transmission stations, four substations, three overhead transmission lines, and two underground cable transmission lines.

The Beijing Construction Engineering Co. Ltd. agreed to implement the project. The total project cost of 650 million MUR was discussed in the Cabinet, however this was greater than the Chinese commitment. In January of 2005, acting foreign affairs minister Arianne Navarre-Marie signed an interest-free loan agreement for 150 million MUR that will be refundable after a 10-year period beginning 2015. It was reported at the time that this loan would partly be used for the construction of a new radio and television station. On January 19th of 2006, Minister of Finance Rama Sithanen signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation agreement with Chinese ambassador Xu Menghsui (as reported) for an interest-free loan of 70 million MUR. At the time, it was slated for projects to be determined. Part of the 70 million MUR loan was used for the headquarters, while part was used to finance radio and TV broadcasting equipment for the company. Finally, in August of 2006, the Chinese government provided an interest-free loan of 100 million CNY for the design, construction, and engineering of the new Mauritius Broadcasting Corp.'s headquarters. This involved the provision of technical assistance. The International Engineering Department of Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (BCEG) began construction in March of 2008.

Then, in 2004, the Cabinet held a Working Session with a Chinese delegation, resulting in a new interest-free loan agreement of 20 million CNY and the decision to use these loan funds for the construction of a new headquarters for the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation at EbÃ¨ne. The Beijing Construction Engineering Co. Ltd. agreed to implement the project. The total project cost of 650 million MUR was discussed in the Cabinet, however this was greater than the Chinese commitment. In January of 2005, acting foreign affairs minister Arianne Navarre-Marie signed an interest-free loan agreement for 150 million MUR that will be refundable after a 10-year period beginning 2015. It was reported at the time that this loan would partly be used for the construction of a new radio and television station. On January 19th of 2006, Minister of Finance Rama Sithanen signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation agreement with Chinese ambassador Xu Menghsui (as reported) for an interest-free loan of 70 million MUR. At the time, it was slated for projects to be determined. Part of the 70 million MUR loan was used for the headquarters, while part was used to finance radio and TV broadcasting equipment for the company. Finally, in August of 2006, the Chinese government provided an interest-free loan of 100 million CNY for the design, construction, and engineering of the new Mauritius Broadcasting Corp.'s headquarters. This involved the provision of technical assistance. The International Engineering Department of Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (BCEG) began construction in March of 2008.

The agreement was signed between Public Utilities Minister Alan Ganoo and Chinese ambassador to Mauritius, Xia Chouan. The project includes 27 km of trunk sewers, 220 km of secondary and tertiary sewers and about 26,500 additional house connections. This Loan carries a 3% percent annual interest and will be reimbursed in 15 years. In 2006, the Export-Import Bank of China agreed to a soft-loan of 800 million CNY for infrastructure. 220 million CNY of this soft-loan was committed as complementary financing for the Plaines Wilhems Sewer project under the condition that the work was completed by a Chinese contractor. In September of 2009, the Sino-Mauritian Joint Council agreed that the balance of 560 million CNY would go to the Bagatelle Dam project. The financing package offered by the Chinese Government was highly concessionary at 2% fixed rate basis as compared to around 4% prevailing rate.

Then, in 2004, the Cabinet held a Working Session with a Chinese delegation, resulting in a new interest-free loan agreement of 20 million CNY and the decision to use these loan funds for the construction of a new headquarters for the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation at EbÃ¨ne. The Beijing Construction Engineering Co. Ltd. agreed to implement the project. The total project cost of 650 million MUR was discussed in the Cabinet, however this was greater than the Chinese commitment. In January of 2005, acting foreign affairs minister Arianne Navarre-Marie signed an interest-free loan agreement for 150 million MUR that will be refundable after a 10-year period beginning 2015. It was reported at the time that this loan would partly be used for the construction of a new radio and television station. On January 19th of 2006, Minister of Finance Rama Sithanen signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation agreement with Chinese ambassador Xu Menghsui (as reported) for an interest-free loan of 70 million MUR. At the time, it was slated for projects to be determined. Part of the 70 million MUR loan was used for the headquarters, while part was used to finance radio and TV broadcasting equipment for the company. Finally, in August of 2006, the Chinese government provided an interest-free loan of 100 million CNY for the design, construction, and engineering of the new Mauritius Broadcasting Corp.'s headquarters. This involved the provision of technical assistance. The International Engineering Department of Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (BCEG) began construction in March of 2008.

The two projects were due to commence in early 2010 and were planned to be financed through two commercial loans of 500 million USD to be obtained by CGC. Each loan was to be backed by FCT land as collateral. The mass housing project was planned to be carried out on a 1,212 hectare area of land near Gwarinpa Estate in Abuja and is expected to be provided with full infrastructure, including roads, electricity, water, and sewage among others. The water supply project will deal with the provision and extension of primary water lines in parts of the FCT including Lugbe and the Kuje regional water supply. Discussions between FCTA and CGC commenced in 2010 over the water supply project, but were not concluded until 2012. In 2012, CGC offered to execute the project at a cost of 575 million USD. If approved, the China Exim Bank would provide a loan facility for the majority of the cost, and the Nigerian Government would provide the rest in the form of counterpart funding. In 2012, FCTA Minister Senator Bala Muhammed directed CGC Nigeria Limited to produce a detailed feasibility study for the â€œGreater Abuja Water Projectâ€. When completed, the project would supply more than 60% of FCTAâ€™s 8,000 square km with potable water. The FCTA also announced that it would embark on the â€œGreater Abuja Water Projectâ€ through a Public Private Partnership with a Chinese company and the World Bank.

However, the loan was reduced to 6 billion USD in October 2009 because the IMF expressed concerns over the DRCâ€™s national debt. The loan was meant to improve Congolese infrastructure and to develop mines in the Mashamba basin, the Dima basin, the Dik Colline D syncline, and Kolwezi. In return, the Congolese state copper company GÃ©camines would concede a number of deposits containing up to 10.6 million tonnes of copper, of which approximately 6.8 million tonnes were confirmed. GÃ©camines also promised between 425,000 and 625,000 tonnes of cobalt and access to all other potential mineral substances. The loanâ€™s infrastructure component totaled 3 billion USD at a 4.4% interest rate. Sicomines Mining Joint Ventureâ€™s loan for developing mines includes a 2.13 billion USD loan at 6.1% interest and a 1.07 billion USD loan at 0% interest. Although the project was originally owned by Sinohydro Corporation (25% share), China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) (43% share), and GÃ©camines (32% share), the CRECâ€™s investment is currently resting on an appeal to the China's National People's Congress Standing Committee. As of May 2013, Chinese enterprises owned 62%, and the rest belonged to GÃ©camines. The Congolese Infrastructure Minister Pierre Lumbi reported that 3 billion USD will be spent on infrastructure, including 2,000 miles of railway between Sakania and Matadi, a 2,000-mile road linking Kisanganiand and Kasumbalesa, a motorway between Lubumbashi and Kasumbalesa, 31 hospitals, 145 health centers, two international-standard universities, and 5,000 government housing units. The motorway between Lubumbashi and Kasumbalesa was constructed by the CREC between March and November 2008, totaling 72 km of road. The transportation projects were planned to be completed within 36 months. As of March 2013, 458 million USD have been released for infrastructure projects, and 540 million USD have been disbursed toward the mining operation. Of the 540 million USD, 350 million USD were used for a signing bonus, the rest for feasibility studies. The initial deal promised to provide China with copper and cobalt over the next 25 years. There are reportedly a total of 13 infrastructure projects implemented with the 458 million USD disbursed under the Sicomines agreement between 2008 and 2012: 1.

Deborah Brautigam argues that despite changes to Exim Bank's variable interest rate of the above-mentioned loan, the deal should still not be counted as ODA. Johanna Janson argued that because the interest rate of Exim Bank's loan fell from 6.6% to 4.4% in a 2009 revised loan agreement, the deal should be labeled as ODA as the IMF- and OECD-calculated grant elements would rise to at least 42%. This fluctuation in the interest rate was included in the deal signed between the consortium of companies, not the Exim Bank. The initial interest rate was set at set at LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Chinese companies are responsible for paying the difference between the 6.6% and 4.4% interest rates.;430;Other Multisector;Infrastructure, Education, Health;Implementation;2;Loan (excluding debt rescheduling);Congo, Dem.

Under this agreement, Nigeria will grant China the first right of refusal to China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) on four oil exploration blocks at an auction next month.China wanted to buy a controlling stake in Nigeria's 110,000 barrel/day Kaduna oil refinery and reconstruct Kaduna's facilities for $2 billion. However, in 2007 China failed to win the auction for Kaduna's stakes. The status of the power station is currently undetermined. The status of the promised infrastructure is unknown.STAFF_NOTES: This oil deal may be connected to an earlier (inactive) $7 billion export credit guarantee by SINOSURE in 2004 (ID#1542). Update: The are three projects attached to this initial agreement as part of Nigeria's 'oil for infrastructure' plan. The 1315 Lagos-Kano section railway, the rehabilitation of the Kaduna oil refinery, and the building of the Mambilla hydroelectric power station. All three projects were put on hold in 2007 after Musa Yar'Adua came into power. These projects are listed under 195, 1999, 1818, and 1990. The Mambilla hydroelectric plant is back under way (1990). A Nigerian news source stated that a Japanese company, Chiyoda Corporation, is rehabilitating the Kaduna refinery. A Chinese firm, Messrs China Civil Engineering Construction Company Nig Ltd, is rehabilitating the railway.

Sino Hydro will install two generators with a total capacity of 360 mW of power, increasing the capacity of the station. Reports said 85% of this would be provided by Exim Bank of China ($340 million), but a 2009 Zambia Ministry of Finance and Planning said the loan agreement was for $315 million. Zesco, state-owned power company will provide the balance for the project budget through funding from the Development Bank of Southern Africa. Fieldstone, an investment banking firm which advised project negotiations, reported that EXIM funded the project through export credits, and the total cost would be $420 million USD. As of 2011, the project was costing $430 million USD, and hopes were that the project will be completed by December 31, 2011. In August 2011, with construction '95% complete', EXIM had only disbursed $325 million. The outstanding amount of USD 105 million required sourced through the loan from the Development Bank of Southern African. In November 2011 it was reported that completion had been delayed a year due to 'financial constraints'. It was also reported the project hit a snag due to water levels near the dam. Additionally, delays were caused in 2009 when a fire broke out in one of the generators. In February 2013, it was reported the lengthy improvements at the Kariba North station had come to an end.

Guangdong Xinguang International Group planned to invest in three stages of the project, and $2 billion was made available by the Nigerian government to commence the projects. The Export-Import Bank of China funded $1 billion for this project and another rail project from Lagos to Kano (ID#195).

The loan partially funds the project's total estimated cost of 430 billion CFA, with the remainder coming from Cameroon's government. Cameroon's government hired the China National Machinery and Equipment Corporation on a 28-month contract for the water project, which will involve construction of a 56-kilometer pipeline from the Sanaga River.

The program will reach 2 million people in the capital city Yaounde and villages along the pipeline.

The project came in response to Kenya's substantial housing deficit. On December 6, 2006, China Development Bank announced that it would provide a 10 million dollar concessionary loan for the housing project, to be repaid in 15 years. The Development Bank of Kenya plans to provide long-term finance of up to 15 years to low and middle income housing project customers. On May 30, 2008 the ground-breaking ceremony of the housing project occurred. The entire project is expected to last about fifteen years (until 2021) or later, but may last longer due to slow progress accredited to court injuctions and land scarcity. As of 2012, only 2,000 housing units have been completed comared to the 40,000 planned for completion.Implementation of the project's first phase involves the production of 720 housing units for sale and appears to have been successfully completed. As of January 2011, the implementing agencies have concentrated their efforts on Phases 2 and 3. The implementation of the project has so far been carried out by implementing agencies China Wu Yi Corporation Limited and Ederman Properties. Construction efforts in the 'Greatwall Apartments' Complex have successfully provided Kenyan citizens with 528 apartments, as well as facilities including shops and school. Another 105 houses have been constructed as part of the Kileleshwa Park Apartments. Further construction efforts include building 700 housing units in Ngara. 1,000 units in Kibera, 700 units in Madaraka and Nairobi West and 105 units in Lang'ata. The project is linked to the Development Financial Cooperation Framework Agreement (DFCFA) signed by the Kenyan government and the China Development Bank in December 2008. As per the DFCFA, the project will operate in accordance with market principles rather than traditional aid.Funding for the package came as part of a 20 million USD credit for housing, education and health care from the China Development Bank.Contacts who have publicly commented on the project include Chinese Ambassador to Kenya Zhang Ming, general director of the Africa Project Development Team Zhu Qingdong, managing director of the Erdemann Property Limited Yang Zeyun and Housing minister Soita Shitanda.

The contract is explicitly for civil work and the steel hydraulic structure of the dam, and is for 60 months. The project is expected to add another 2,600MW to Nigeriaâ€™s national grid. According to Feng Jun, the Vice Director of the Beijing liaison office, the plant will cost around $5 billion, mostly financed by the Nigerian government and accented by a $300 million loan from the Export-Import Bank of China. The project was scheduled to be completed by 2012. However, Sunrise Power and Transmission Ltd, a bidder shortlisted on bidding for the project, initiated legal action against the Federal government in 2007, which stalled the project. The federal government insisted on finishing the project by the end of the president's administration in 2015, which the contractors openly contested as impossible. In 2012, the project capacity increased to 3,050 MW, and President Jonathan said the project design was complete. According to a 2012 article, EXIM Bank of China promised 75 per cent of the project cost, with counterpart funding in the sum of $309 million from the Nigerian government. According to a June 2013 report, the government of Nigeria had just approved counterpart funding for a 3050MW Mambilla hydroelectric plant located in Taraba State, which would cost a total of $3.2 billion, and be built China Gezhouba Group Company and Sinohydro. There is some disagreement in sources on the current implementing agencies of the project. The project will generate revenue to repay the loan. Sinohydro will build the power plant at its expense and operate it for nine years before transferring ownership to the Nigerian government.;230;Energy Generation and Supply;Hydroelectric Power;Pipeline: Commitment;11;Loan (excluding debt rescheduling);Nigeria;"http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=AEIN000020050712e1610009i&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=EM00000020060412e24c00001&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.eoearth.org/article/Energy_profile_of_Nigeria, NGO/Civil Society/Advocacy; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020070208e32800038&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.china.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/fg57/Lehre/0809_Wasserwirtschaft/China_dam_guide.pdf, Other; http://www.nigeriafirst.org/article_11815.shtml, Other; http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-11-07/nigeria-china-s-sinohydro-sign-accord-for-power-plant, Other; http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=104631:work-commences-on-3759mw-mambilla-zungeru-plants&catid=94:energy-report&Itemid=592, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.codewit.com/business-news/8565-nigeria-fg-approves-1-72-bn-counterpart-funding-for-hydro-dams, Other; http://www.internationalrivers.org/resources/mambilla-dam-nigeria-3596, NGO/Civil Society/Advocacy; http://world.people.com.cn/n/2012/1110/c1002-19537539.html , Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://fmi.gov.ng/water-power-and-irrigation-collaboration-to-step-up-business-in-nigeria-vp-sambo/, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)";12;Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency;"China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd.

The loan is referred to as the 'Master Loan Program.'

The project was 85% financed through a soft loan from the Chinese government on a 3% interest rate. The 15% balance would be sourced by the state government from local banks. By 2006, the state government had already released 30 million naira to local cassava farmers to facilitate mass production of the commodity.

On October 30, 2006, the Chinese Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) and the Ministry of Transportation of Nigeria signed a contract worth 8.3 billion USD for the implementation of the Lagos-Kano Railway Modernization Project and was linked with the 2006 China-Nigeria 'Oil for Infrastructure agreement' (ID#1844). The price of the project was reduced to 8 billion USD in 2009. China agreed to help finance the project with a 2.5 billion USD loan. In order to release funding pressures, the project was planned to be implemented in phases. The first phase of the project includes modernizing the 186.5 km Abuja to Kaduna section of the 1,313 km railway from Lagos to Kano. The cost of the first phase is projected to be 849,750,903 USD and will be constructed over 36 months. The second phase of the project is the Lagos-Ibadan section of the railway, a double track line with a total length of 156.8km and a projected speed of 150km per hour for both passengers and freight transportation. This portion is worth approximately 1.487 billion USD with a construction period of 36 months. In July 2013, the Minister of Transportation reported that 65% of the work on the Abuja-Kaduna line had been completed, while the contract for Lagos-Ibadan double track had been signed but was pending the completion of an agreement with the China Exim bank. PPIAF-ID:206 However, Deborah Brautigam reported in December 2010 that after CCECC won the $8.3 billion contract, the Chinese government had offered a line of export credit for 2 billion USD at a competitive commercial rate, as well as a preferential export credit of 500 million USD.

The project involved the construction of 3,000 small dams that would be used in 'small-scale, water-controlled agriculture.' 10,000 Nigerians were trained on how to build and control small dams within the initial four years that the Chinese team worked in the country. Four or five small dams were built in each local government area within the period. Bello also said the program would lead to enhanced GDP and environmental protection. In September 2002, Nigeria embarked on the irrigation of small dams with the assistance of China and the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). In 2003, China, Nigeria and FAO signed the South-South Cooperation tripartite agreement. Over 500 agricultural experts and technicians have been fielded to-date. Areas of activities and applied technologies are small-scale water control, fisheries, livestock, crop production, rural energy, agroprocessing, etc. STAFF_NOTES: The $20 million is an investment funded by Nigeria.

The fiber optic network will cover the whole country providing more durable and efficient common bandwidth for all communication service providers. Under the project, all regional capitals and 36 major towns would be linked by fiber optics to enhance rural telephone and internet services. The fiber optics will be linked with Kumasi and further to the north, subsequently connecting Accra. The first phase of the project, upgrading the existing fiber optic network and expanding the communications network in the southern loop, is expected to be completed in January of 2008, and the second phase, the expansion of the network to parts of northern Ghana, is expected to be completed by the end of 2008. Ghanaian Minister of Communications Albert Kan Dapaah and VP of China's Eximbank met to agree on the deal. Deputy Minister of Communication in Ghana Dr. Benjamin Aggrey Ntim was also familiar with the project.

It was debated in the Parliament in late 2009 in which it passed the authorization of the loan. In 2010 or 2011 the Malawi Parliament further authorized the government to go ahead and borrow the funds from the Export-Import Bank of China. The national stadium would have a seating capacity of 40,000 people, a standard natural grass football area and 10 synthetic tracks. Planning for the national stadium has been tied up in debates of where to locate the stadium--there was a move to change its proposed location from Lilongwe to Blantyre, but as of May 2012 it appears that Lilongwe will eventually be the site of the stadium. A US government cable also indicated that this project will ultimately be paid for by the Malawian people.

The funds will repair damaged infrastructure, mainly railway tracks bombed in the countryâ€™s civil war. The money will also build roads, electrify slums surrounding the capital, and fund rehabilitation of the water supply systems. The total amount of funding available for the first phase of the project is 1 billion USD. This phase involves 27 contracts, including 50 projects of which 21 have been confirmed completed. The projects focus on electricity, water, health, education, and public works. Each project is to receive 20 percent of the total amount. As of September 2007, 733.1 million USD had been released, and 1.6 million USD was still available for Phase 1. The Chinese loan is at LIBOR plus 1.5% and has a grace period of five years and a maturity of twelve years. These characteristics suggest that it is most likely non-concessional. Chinese state company China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) is rebuilding 371 km of the national road linking Kifangondo (Luanda), Caxito (Bengo), UÃ­ge and Negage (UÃ­ge) in Angola. The project, which began in December 2005, is estimated to cost 211 million USD. The rebuilding project includes 12 bridges, of which 10 will be newly constructed, and requires over 200 aqueducts to be built. The project was expected to be done in June 2008, but a PPIAF source stated that the project was completed on July 25, 2008. The No. 1 and No. 2 ring roads (bypasses) of the Angola City (likely to be Luanda - no other Angolan city is large enough to have ring roads) appear to have been assisted by a Chinese commitment of 170 million USD. Chinaâ€™s Exim Bank and the China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) seem to have some connection to the project. If this project refers to Luanda ring road, it was constructed by Brazilian contractor Odebrecht according to a Macau newspaper but was nevertheless funded by China. STAFF_NOTE: (1)Potential for double-counting identified between this project and another vague development projects in Angola. (2) Project linked to ID #11612 for Phase 2. (3) According to an article in Africa Confidential, Angola must allocate 10,000 barrels of oil per day as repayment of the loan.

Funding for the second phase of the project was $199.8 million USD according to the Ministry of Finance (as of September 2007), with another $5.5 million USD still available. It appears that roughly $30 million USD will go to each project. As part of this contract, public tenders for the construction and civil engineering contracts will be awarded primarily to Chinese state-owned enterprises to be approved by the Chinese government. The Export-Import Bank of China is funding the projects. The oil to be received by China includes 10,000 barrels of oil per day. It appears that state-owned Luanda Electricity Distribution Company (EDEL) is carrying out the project. It is unclear if the project has been completed in full.

The project has a total length of 1,776 kilometers and has seven electric substations, and was constructed by Harbin Power Equipment Company Limited. The contract includes building two 500kv parallel transmission lines from the Power Plant to Khartoum with a distance of 350 km for each line, with two 500/200kv sub-stations in Omdurman and Khartoum North, connected with a 38km line of 500kv. A third 240km long line will be extended to Atbara, with a voltage of 500kv, accompanied with a 500/200kv sub-station in Atbara. A fourth 455km line will stretch from Atbara to Port Sudan, with a voltage of 220kv, and a 220/110kv sub-station in Port Sudan. The fifth 310km line will be extended from Merowe Dam to Dongola. This line has 220kv and three 220/33kv sub-stations in Merowe, Debba and Dongola. The project was completed in May 2007. The exact start date is unknown.

The loan was granted by the Export-Import Bank of China, but the trains and locomotives have already been purchased, and TransNamib will deliver the first four machines for $12 million USD each. From a report in 2008, it appears that TransNamib ultimately purchased 17 red Chinese-made locomotives in addition to the four blue ones originally purchased. However, these purchases appear to be a strain on the company because of chronic mechanical problems. The project is likely tied with mineral resources, especially uranium.

Then, in 2004, the Cabinet held a Working Session with a Chinese delegation, resulting in a new interest-free loan agreement of 20 million CNY and the decision to use these loan funds for the construction of a new headquarters for the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation at EbÃ¨ne. The Beijing Construction Engineering Co. Ltd. agreed to implement the project. The total project cost of 650 million MUR was discussed in the Cabinet, however this was greater than the Chinese commitment. In January of 2005, acting foreign affairs minister Arianne Navarre-Marie signed an interest-free loan agreement for 150 million MUR that will be refundable after a 10-year period beginning 2015. It was reported at the time that this loan would partly be used for the construction of a new radio and television station. On January 19th of 2006, Minister of Finance Rama Sithanen signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation agreement with Chinese ambassador Xu Menghsui (as reported) for an interest-free loan of 70 million MUR. At the time, it was slated for projects to be determined. Part of the 70 million MUR loan was used for the headquarters, while part was used to finance radio and TV broadcasting equipment for the company. Finally, in August of 2006, the Chinese government provided an interest-free loan of 100 million CNY for the design, construction, and engineering of the new Mauritius Broadcasting Corp.'s headquarters. This involved the provision of technical assistance. The International Engineering Department of Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (BCEG) began construction in March of 2008.

The project includes 27 km of trunk sewers, 220 km of secondary and tertiary sewers and about 26,500 additional house connections.

The first component of stage 2, the construction of a new interrnational terminal, was allegedly funded through a $75 million USD mixed loan from China.

Additionally, reports state that second component of phase 2, the construction of the domestic terminal, cost 75 million dollars funded by China in the form of a low interest loan.

Ltd. planned to team up with an Africa development fund set up by the Chinese government to build a 200 mW gas-fired power plant in Ghana. The firm plans to form a venture in Ghana with the China-Africa Development Fund to develop the project, estimated at $137.2 million USD. The project would be installed with two generators currently used at power plants owned by the listed firm and its parent. The 200 mW power plant will be the first phase of a 560 mW project planned in Ghana. In April of 2008, Ghanaian president John Kufuor took part in the ground breaking ceremony at the power station at Kpone near Tema. There is some debate over the actual value of the project; it is possible that the project is actually worth $143 million USD. The project will be conducted by Sunon Asogli Power, the joint venture between Shenzhen (60%) and the Development Fund (40%). The project created controversy when Volta Aluminum Company (VALCO), which owned an idle plot of land 300metres away from the land sold to Sunon Asogli Power, built several metres of solid block wall to stop Sunon Asogli Power from gaining access to the construction site. (Shenzen had already spent $50million to prepare the site). Activists protested that VALCO did not have a rightful claim to the idle land, since it was bought from the government in 1952 through compulsory acquisition which forcibly displaced local people. With the vocal support of these local activists, the first phase of the gas project was completed in April 2009. Later, the capacity will be increased to 560 MW. The first phase was completed within 15 months [started August of 2007]. The majority of the engineers, consultants and managers of the project will be Chinese, but it will employ 1,000 Ghanaians. It appears that further construction may have increased the value of the project to $600 million USD in 2009, and in 2012 the partners planned to invest an additional $300 million USD. but it appears that the second phase of the project is still being implemented.

Ghanaian Minister of Communications Albert Kan Dapaah, Chinese ambassador to Ghana Lu Yonjshou, CEO of GT Oystein Bjorge, and Chairman of Alcatel Shanghai Bell Yuan Xin are all familiar with the project. In December 2003, the project was suspended because of a lawsuit against GT by Malaysian G-Gom. According to reports in 2005, the project was continued with the installation of 250 radio antenna to serve about 400,000 mobile phone users with the help of 60 Chinese engineers. It is still unclear if the project was completed. There appears to be some discrepancy between the amounts, reports include $67 million USD and $79 million USD, but it is unclear exactly how the money was designated. Sources confirmed that Phase 2 was beginning in 2005. In 2005, Ghana Telecom signed a buyer credit agreement with Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Bank (SG CIB) worth $67 million USD. The agreement carried a maturity of 6 years. Funds would be used to upgrade and expand Ghana Telecom's networks, financing the import of equipment from Alcatel Shanghai Bell. The loan is insured by Sinosure, the Chinese export credit agency. Phase 2 of Ghana telecom project includes the supply of fixed network exchanges, mobile network equipment, and optical transfer equipment. Sinosure prevented default on this deal, after receiving preliminary notice of potential default in February 2007. There is some confusion that Phase 2 might be a 50-50 Chinese-French joint venture. The total cost for Phase 2 appears to be $80 million USD, and the Chinese will commit $67 million USD.

Lack of funding has stalled the project whose total cost is estimated to be 1 billion USD. Attempts were initially made to link the project to various proposals for building alumina refineries, but the relevant investors could not be persuaded to help finance the construction of the dam. Originally reported to generate 750 MW, later updates reveal that the Souapiti station would actually generate 515 mW of electricity and could supply not only the capital but also many industrial projects, such as the alumina refineries and areas outside Conakry. The 850 million USD in financing is being organized through China's Exim Bank. Two Chinese state-owned construction companies, Sinohydro and China Power Investment Co (CPI) are to build the dam. The dam will likely be linked to the Kaleta and Amaria mines. It is unclear what the current status of the project is, but it appears that the project is still under consideration. STAFF_NOTE: The International Rivers' spreadsheet confirmed that this was distinct from project ID #13823, confirmed the wattage at 515 mW, and confirmed that the project is still in a pipeline stage.

Then, in 2004, the Cabinet held a Working Session with a Chinese delegation, resulting in a new interest-free loan agreement of 20 million CNY and the decision to use these loan funds for the construction of a new headquarters for the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation at EbÃ¨ne. The Beijing Construction Engineering Co. Ltd. agreed to implement the project. The total project cost of 650 million MUR was discussed in the Cabinet, however this was greater than the Chinese commitment. In January of 2005, acting foreign affairs minister Arianne Navarre-Marie signed an interest-free loan agreement for 150 million MUR that will be refundable after a 10-year period beginning 2015. It was reported at the time that this loan would partly be used for the construction of a new radio and television station. On January 19th of 2006, Minister of Finance Rama Sithanen signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation agreement with Chinese ambassador Xu Menghsui (as reported) for an interest-free loan of 70 million MUR. At the time, it was slated for projects to be determined. Part of the 70 million MUR loan was used for the headquarters, while part was used to finance radio and TV broadcasting equipment for the company. Finally, in August of 2006, the Chinese government provided an interest-free loan of 100 million CNY for the design, construction, and engineering of the new Mauritius Broadcasting Corp.'s headquarters. This involved the provision of technical assistance. The International Engineering Department of Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (BCEG) began construction in March of 2008.

Agricultural uses for the US$200 million loan include the payment of agricultural equipment, chemicals, and other critical requirements. The shipment of fertilizer is expected to arrive in Zimbabwe at the beginning of October 2006 to help farmers deal with crop shortages. The loan is being facilitated by both the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and the Export-Import Bank of China. The Zimbabwean government was represented by Gideon Gono, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, while the fertilizer agreement is a result of a visit to China made by the Vice President of Zimbabwe, Joice Mujuru, and the Zimbabwe Secretary of Economic Development, A. Bvumbe.The first consignment of fertilizer from China arrived into Zimbabwe by December 26, 2012, although the amount of fertilizer was not specified. The fertilizer in question was of Compound Types D, S, C, and L. On February 1, 2007, Samuel Muvuti, acting chief executive of the state-owned Zimbabwe Grain Marketing Board, announced that a second shipment of 13,000 tonnes of fertilizer procured through the US$200 million loan was delivered to Zimbabwe via Mozambique from China with 8,000 tonnes still in transit and 14,000 tonnes awaiting transportation at port in Mozambique with the goal of delivering the fertilizer from the port by mid-February 2007. As of this date, only 57,000 tonnes of the agreed 387,000 had arrived in the country.In 2006, the government of Zimbabwe agreed to mortgage the loan from China using platinum mining concessions from the Selous and Northfields Mines. The mining transactions were to occur through the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC) and Chinese mining firm Wanbao Mining. However, in a different US$200 million deal with Eximbank, also in 2006, these same mining areas were also up for collateral, causing both deals to stall. On July 11, 2009, Minister Biti signed another memorandum of understanding with the Chinese company Wanbao to free up the mining concessions in Selous and Northfields and allow Wanbao to being mining after the clarification and finalization of legal documentation between the Chinese and the Zimbabwean governments. The terms of the agreement include: the value of the commercial contract should be more than US$2 million.The portion of the Chinese content of exported goods should be no less than 50% of the total value. The cash payment (down payment) made by the importer to the Chinese exporter should not be less than 15% of the total contract value or 20% in the case of ship export contract. The export buyer's credit provided by the Eximbank of China for an export project of goods or services shall not exceed 85% of the total contract value, and 80% in the case of a ship export contract. Additional research into the completion date of the fertilizer delivery was unsuccessful. In 2007, a consignment of 1,000 more tractors and an assortment of other related farming implements worth $100 million USD from China was expected to arrive. The implements include harvesters, irrigation pumps, disc harrows, planters, and electricity generators. As of November of 2011, the facilities were being shipped from China to Zimbabwe. These goods compose the remaining value of the $200 million USD Chinese government loan. It appears that Zimbabwe purchased 97 trucks under the deal, but no financial value for the project was given. However, as of July 2012, it does appear that Zimbabwe defaulted on its repayment of the $200 million USD loan. China has extended the repayment period for the buyer's credit loan from five years to eight years.;310;Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing;;Implementation;2;Loan (excluding debt rescheduling);Zimbabwe;"http://www.newzimbabwe.com/news-8340-Zimbabwe%2525252520defaults%2525252520on%2525252520$200m%2525252520China%2525252520loan/news.aspx, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://allafrica.com/stories/200801030076.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://allafrica.com/stories/200711020023.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.zfhz.org/english/newsdis.asp?id=662&stype=24&type=4, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020060913e29d001ib&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://allafrica.com/stories/200612140090.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://zimbabwenewsonline.com/top_news/117.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.rbz.co.zw/pdfs/ps_ForexFacilities.pdf, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://rawstory.com/news/2006/Zimbabwe_secures_loans_of_490_milli_09142006.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020060928e29s00039&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://vlex.cn/vid/roundup-zimbabwe-strengthen-cooperation-212657761, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://allafrica.com/stories/200801080232.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://world.people.com.cn/GB/1029/42359/5203816.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks";13;Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency;;Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency;1;"Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC), State-Owned Company; Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), State-Owned Company";2;Checked;1;OOF-like;3;Development;1;Active;1;"http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020060913e29d001ib&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020060928e29s00039&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks";200000000;USD;0,743052144;1;269160114,3;200000000;01.
