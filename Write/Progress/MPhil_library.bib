Colonial era railway construction in Kenya provides a natural experiment to study the emergence and persistence of a spatial equilibrium. Data spanning over one century show that railways determined the location of European settlers, Asian traders and the main cities at independence. Europeans then left, Asians departed and railways declined in the immediate post-independence period, constituting local shocks to physical and human capital. Yet the colonial cities persisted. We test four explanations for path dependence based on institutional persistence, technological change, sunk investments and spatial coordination failures.},

Much of the literature presumes that "history" sets initial conditions that determine the outcome, but an alternative view stresses the role of "expectations," i.e., of self-fulfilling prophecy. This paper uses a simple trade model with both external economies and adjustment costs to show how the parameters of the economy determine the relative importance of history and expectations in determining equilibrium.},

Cocoa growing spread in Western Nigeria through the efforts of migrant farmers, many of whom relied on traditional, non-economic institutions, such as the lineage or ethnic community, to mobilize the economic resources they needed to establish cocoa farms. From an examination of the activities of migrant farmers in three Yoruba states-Ibadan, Ife and Ondo-it is argued that the spread of cocoa farming probably strengthened these traditional institutions. At the same time, it has effected significant changes in the volume, organization and geographical distribution of rural economic activity in Western Nigeria.},

The patterns of cross-correlations between potential explanatory variables and their different degree of endogeneity makes it hard to make unqualified statements about competing explanations for economic growth and the quality of government. Our new data, which features the underlying group structure of ethnicities, religions and languages, also allows the computation of alternative measures of heterogeneity, and we turn to measures of polarization as an alternative to the commonly used index of fractionalization.},

In order to realize scale economies while minimizing transport costs, manufacturing firms tend to locate in the region with larger demand, but the location of demand itself depends on the distribution of manufacturing. Emergence of a core-periphery pattern depends on transportation costs, economies of scale, and the share of manufacturing in national income.},

In fact in the most important oil producing region, the Bight of Biafra, the palm oil trade expanded well in advance of any decline in the slave trade and the suppression of the slave trade occasioned no marked increase in the rate of palm oil export growth. It would appear that the direct and indirect effects of the slave trade in this region had created economic conditions which enabled its small farmers to respond so rapidly to external demand for palm oil. The failure to understand the relationship between the slave and the palm oil trades is a result of misunderstanding the relationship between these oil producers and the coastal middlemen.},

Until 1913 the rise of the gold standard and the fall in transport costs were the main trade-creating forces. As of 1929 the reversal was driven by higher transport costs. In the 1930s the final collapse of the gold standard drove trade volumes even lower.},

Low transport productivity can distort the allocation of resources across geographically dispersed production units within sectors and between agriculture and nonagriculture. I infer cross-country transport productivity disparities from observed domestic transport costs and transport infrastructure stocks. ``Endowing'' rich countries with the transport productivity of poor countries would reduce their income by 10\%. Combining transport productivity disparities with disparities in nonagricultural productivity and arable land the model yields a 50\% higher rich\textendash{}poor income ratio than the two-sector model.},

  volume = {38},
  issn = {0021-8537},
  abstract = {Throughout the period 1939 to 1949 the lack of expansion in palm oil exports from Nigeria was a source of much concern to imperial and colonial government officials. To the former, it limited Nigeria's contribution both to the alleviation of metropolitan and worldwide shortages in fats and oils, and more significantly, Britain's efforts to reconstruct its post-war economy. To the latter, it jeopardized the future of the heavily populated eastern region of Nigeria and the long-term welfare of the industry. However, despite their concerns both the imperial and colonial governments were unable to devise a coherent set of policies to secure an expansion in export production. In retrospect failure was inevitable, because for most of the period under review, colonial government policy was opposed to a radical overhaul in the system of oil palm production and changes were predicated on the notion that the industry should remain a peasant industry. Consequently, between 1942 and 1948 Nigerian oil palm producers did not capitalize on the opportunity for expansion which resulted from the international shortage in fats and oils. By 1948, the failure to expand export production threatened to destabilize the economy of the eastern region, the centre of the Nigerian oil palm produce industry. Confronted by this reality, the colonial authorities accepted that the oil palm produce industry could not survive without the introduction of a plantation system.},

  abstract = {Optimal transport theory is used widely to solve problems in mathematics and some areas of the sciences, but it can also be used to understand a range of problems in applied economics, such as the matching between job seekers and jobs, the determinants of real estate prices, and the formation of matrimonial unions. This is the first text to develop clear applications of optimal transport to economic modeling, statistics, and econometrics. It covers the basic results of the theory as well as their relations to linear programming, network flow problems, convex analysis, and computational geometry. Emphasizing computational methods, it also includes programming examples that provide details on implementation. Applications include discrete choice models, models of differential demand, and quantile-based statistical estimation methods, as well as asset pricing models. The book also features numerous exercises throughout that help to develop mathematical agility, deepen computational skills, and strengthen economic intuition.},
