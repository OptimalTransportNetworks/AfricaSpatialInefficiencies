\opening{Dear Editors,}

I am writing to submit my manuscript \emph{``Spatial Inefficiencies in Africa's Trade Network''} for you to consider for publication in The Review of Economics and Statistics.

My paper aims to identify efficiency gaps in the trade network design of national infrastructure systems in Africa. With a lot of spatial data and recent advances from optimal transport theory, I attempt to derive the unique welfare-optimising road system for every country on the continent. I then explore why Africa's current transport networks diverge from the social optimum.

I would be delighted to hear your thoughts on my work. Thank you for volunteering your time and considering my paper at your excellent journal.

Best regards,
\\
