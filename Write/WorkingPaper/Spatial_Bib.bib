These measures are more comprehensive than those previously used in the economics literature and we compare our new variables with those previously used. We also revisit the question of the effects of ethnic, linguistic, and religious heterogeneity on the quality of institutions and growth. We partly confirm and partly modify previous results. The patterns of cross-correlations between potential explanatory variables and their different degree of endogeneity makes it hard to make unqualified statements about competing explanations for economic growth and the quality of government. Our new data, which features the underlying group structure of ethnicities, religions and languages, also allows the computation of alternative measures of heterogeneity, and we turn to measures of polarization as an alternative to the commonly used index of fractionalization.},

  abstract = {The history of cocoa production in Western Nigeria is an example of a successful innovation in the Schumpeterian sense of the term-a new productive activity which, when adopted by a number of producers, leads to economic growth and structural change within a given institutional and social context. Cocoa growing spread in Western Nigeria through the efforts of migrant farmers, many of whom relied on traditional, non-economic institutions, such as the lineage or ethnic community, to mobilize the economic resources they needed to establish cocoa farms. From an examination of the activities of migrant farmers in three Yoruba states-Ibadan, Ife and Ondo-it is argued that the spread of cocoa farming probably strengthened these traditional institutions. At the same time, it has effected significant changes in the volume, organization and geographical distribution of rural economic activity in Western Nigeria.},

  volume = {38},
  issn = {0021-8537},
  abstract = {Throughout the period 1939 to 1949 the lack of expansion in palm oil exports from Nigeria was a source of much concern to imperial and colonial government officials. To the former, it limited Nigeria's contribution both to the alleviation of metropolitan and worldwide shortages in fats and oils, and more significantly, Britain's efforts to reconstruct its post-war economy. To the latter, it jeopardized the future of the heavily populated eastern region of Nigeria and the long-term welfare of the industry. However, despite their concerns both the imperial and colonial governments were unable to devise a coherent set of policies to secure an expansion in export production. In retrospect failure was inevitable, because for most of the period under review, colonial government policy was opposed to a radical overhaul in the system of oil palm production and changes were predicated on the notion that the industry should remain a peasant industry. Consequently, between 1942 and 1948 Nigerian oil palm producers did not capitalize on the opportunity for expansion which resulted from the international shortage in fats and oils. By 1948, the failure to expand export production threatened to destabilize the economy of the eastern region, the centre of the Nigerian oil palm produce industry. Confronted by this reality, the colonial authorities accepted that the oil palm produce industry could not survive without the introduction of a plantation system.},

Until 1913 the rise of the gold standard and the fall in transport costs were the main trade-creating forces. As of 1929 the reversal was driven by higher transport costs. In the 1930s the final collapse of the gold standard drove trade volumes even lower.},

It would appear that the direct and indirect effects of the slave trade in this region had created economic conditions which enabled its small farmers to respond so rapidly to external demand for palm oil. The failure to understand the relationship between the slave and the palm oil trades is a result of misunderstanding the relationship between these oil producers and the coastal middlemen.},

This note tests whether or not donors have traditionally acted on this rhetoric by examining if aid targets areas of poverty within Nigeria, Senegal, and Uganda. Unlike prior research on aid targeting, the analysis covers aid from nearly all donors and does not aggregate variables into spatial regions. Instead, I measure the distance from geotagged survey data tracking poverty to aid projects started just after each survey wave. I show that projects are placed closer to richer people.

  abstract = {Africa's demand for urban housing is soaring, even as it faces a proliferation of slums. In this setting, can modest infrastructure investments in greenfield areas where people subsequently build their own homes lead to better quality neighborhoods in the long run? We study "Sites and Services" projects implemented in seven Tanzanian cities during the 1970s and 1980s, and we compare greenfield areas that received basic infrastructure investment (de novo areas) to geographically proximate greenfield areas that did not (control areas). Using satellite images, surveys, and census data from the 2010s, we find that de novo areas developed into neighborhoods with much better housing quality. Specifically, de novo neighborhoods are more orderly and their buildings have larger footprint areas and are more likely to have multiple stories and better amenities, due not only to the persistence of initial investments but also to private complementary investments. We also document the role of sorting of owners and residents, which only partly accounts for the differences in housing quality across neighborhoods. Finally, we study initially squatted areas that were also upgraded as part of ``Sites and Services'', and our descriptive evidence suggests that they are now if anything worse than the control areas. We conclude that preemptive infrastructure investments can lead to neighborhoods with significantly better housing in the long run.},

The unit of analysis is an approximately 50 km \^A 50 km cell that is tiled across the continent to form a grid of roughly 10,500 cells. I aggregate geotagged aid from each donor into the grid cells in three ways: a binary measure marking if a cell received any aid, the count of aid projects per cell, and each cell's dollar value of aid. I operationalize poverty at the grid cell level in five ways: light at night, mean travel time from the cell to a major city, distance from the centroid of the cell to the recipient's capital city, and cell-level estimates of child malnutrition and infant mortality. I test for the influence of each poverty variable in models that control for the population within each cell and include recipient country fixed effects. Aid flows to richer rather than poorer cells.},

  doi = {10.1144/GSL.SP.1998.132.01.06},
  abstract = {The Ghadames Basin is a large intra-cratonic basin, covering portions of Algeria, Tunisia and Libya. The three countries are independently conducting petroleum exploration in their portions of the basin, using different play concepts and consequently obtaining different exploration results. This paper presents the first published basin-wide view of petroleum stratigraphy and play types. Some 700 exploratory wells have been drilled in the basin, resulting in the discovery of at least 150 oil pools with 9500 MMBO (million barrels of oil) in place. Most wells were located in the structurally higher parts of the basin, with deeper portions being less explored because of shifting dune conditions and an expectation of reservoir thinning into the basin centre. Silurian and Devonian source rocks occur across large parts of the basin and have generated volumes of hydrocarbon orders of magnitude above those discovered. The numerous structural phases (Taconic, Caledonian, Hercynian and Austrian) that have affected the basin have had important implications for depocentre migration, structural style, and for patterns of trap formation, alteration and destruction. The erosion pattern and topography developed on the Hercynian unconformity is a key control on petroleum systems within the basin, controlling the preservation of Palaeozoic hydrocarbons, communication between source and higher reservoirs and patterns of long-distance migration in the Triassic reservoir. For each of the producing plays, an analysis is presented of the geological factors controlling the habitat of hydrocarbons (e.g. the effect of various tectonic phases, the influence of basin-scale facies variations on reservoir quality, and the source rock-reservoir relationship), and is related to the variations that have been observed in exploration success rate and producibility. It is believed that a substantial volume of hydrocarbons still remains undiscovered in a range of trap and play types.},

We find a strong, positive relation between current income per capita and colonial European settlement that is robust to controlling for the current proportion of the population of European descent, as well as many other country characteristics. The results suggest that any adverse effects of extractive institutions associated with small European settlements were, even at low levels of colonial European settlement, more than offset by other things that Europeans brought, such as human capital and technology.},

The model implies that if politicians are sufficiently inclined to favor their home areas, centralization will reduce social welfare relative to decentralization. Moreover, other approaches to controlling the effects of favoritism, such as constitutional equal treatment spending clauses that constrain politicians from focusing resources on their home areas, will increase corruption relative to decentralization. An incentive-compatible choice experiment in which 179 elected county councilors in rural Kenya chose among alternative water infrastructure projects reveals substantial favoritism. We estimate that politicians value each person served in their home village more than twice as much as each person served outside their home village. Consistent with the model, politicians are more likely to value controlling the discretionary funding associated with the project when they do not control the location of the project.},

  abstract = {Differential institutions imposed during colonial rule continue to affect the spatial structure and urban interactions in African cities. Based on a sample of 318 cities across 28 countries using satellite data on built cover over time, Anglophone origin cities sprawl compared to Francophone ones. Anglophone cities have less intense land use and more irregular layout in the older colonial portions of cities, and more leapfrog development at the extensive margin. Results are impervious to a border experiment, many robustness tests, measures of sprawl, and sub-samples. Why would colonial origins matter? The British operated under indirect rule and a dual mandate within cities, allowing colonial and native sections to develop without an overall plan and coordination. In contrast, integrated city planning and land allocation mechanisms were a feature of French colonial rule, which was inclined to direct rule. The results also have public policy relevance. From the Demographic and Health Survey, similar households which are located in areas of the city with more leapfrog development have poorer connections to piped water, electricity, and landlines, presumably because of higher costs of providing infrastructure with urban sprawl.},

Combining multiple data sources, I present evidence that they were very unequally distributed across the districts of 16 British and French African colonies. How did colonial states allocate their investments? Some focus on ethnic disparities in colonial treatment, following a divide and rule logic, while others emphasize the role of natural resources. I argue that observable geographic features led some places to become centers of pre-colonial coastal trade, which increased later colonial investments not only in infrastructure but also in health and education. Although the context was highly extractive, pre-colonial commerce also helps explain the limited diffusion of investments within each colony. A de facto decentralized colonial state and European settlement are two of the mechanisms behind the persistence of inequality over time.},

  abstract = {Optimal transport theory is used widely to solve problems in mathematics and some areas of the sciences, but it can also be used to understand a range of problems in applied economics, such as the matching between job seekers and jobs, the determinants of real estate prices, and the formation of matrimonial unions. This is the first text to develop clear applications of optimal transport to economic modeling, statistics, and econometrics. It covers the basic results of the theory as well as their relations to linear programming, network flow problems, convex analysis, and computational geometry. Emphasizing computational methods, it also includes programming examples that provide details on implementation. Applications include discrete choice models, models of differential demand, and quantile-based statistical estimation methods, as well as asset pricing models. The book also features numerous exercises throughout that help to develop mathematical agility, deepen computational skills, and strengthen economic intuition.},
